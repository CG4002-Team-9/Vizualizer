# Visualizer
* This code is the source code for the main logic components of the Unity Visualizer as written by Group B09. It is not designed to be able to run directly, but rather to be built into a standalone iOS / Android application. In order to test out and run the visualizer, you will need to build the project in Unity.

## Setup
Kindly request the Unity project from the [project owner](mailto:unity@mothernewbee.com)
The Unity project is not included in this repository due to its large size.
